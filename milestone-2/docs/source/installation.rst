Stable release
--------------

`airbnb_prediction` can be installed using `poetry`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry install

This is the preferred method to install `airbnb_prediction`, as it will also install the exact versions of all dependencies used to develop the package (listed in `poetry.lock`).
